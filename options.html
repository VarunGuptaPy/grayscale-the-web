  <h1>Grayscale - Manage Saved Sites</h1>
  <p>Use the form below to manually save sites you would like grayscaled. Make sure to add the site name with the end part after the ".", like a .com or a .gov, otherwise your entry won't work, even if it's appears in the list.
  <p>Example: If you wanted to add www.google.com, you just need to enter google.com. If you just enter "google", it will appear in the list, but it won't work.</p>
  <p>Please note that subdomains won't work with this. So if you add something like "pictures.facebook.com", it will just add "facebook.com". The grayscale will then work for any site with facebook.com<p>
  <p>If all of this is too confusing, it may be easier to add/remove sites using the pop up menu as you go by clicking the Grayscale icon in your chrome menu bar.</p>
